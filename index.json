    "content": "This is my last project at MathWorks Robotics Team (who develops the Robotics System Toolbox (RST)). Inspired by Haddadin\u0026rsquo;s famous demo, the idea is to demonstrate manipulator algorithms in RST for the safe robot-environment interaction to a ROS-enabled robot. In this project I implemented Haddadin\u0026rsquo;s time scaling method to achieve safe trajectory tracking on the Sawyer from Rethink Robotics. The purpose of this project is threefold:\n Contributed an simulation in Simulink with Simscape Multibody to showcase the usage of Robotics Manipulator Blocks. Using RST to test different APIs with the experiments on Sawyer through Robot Operating System (ROS), including the MATLAB code with ROS functions, the Simulink implementation with ROS blocks, and C++ code generated the from Simulink as a ROS node that can directly run on Sawyer. As part of the demonstrations presented in an annual company-wise event.  In the Simulink example, I also implemented a simple contact model (as a spring damper system) to simulate the interaction between the end-effector of the Sawyer and the environment. The extended (marketing) video adapted from this project has been posted on MATLAB Facebook page since this September and currently got 15k views!\n",

Modified from Michael Posa\u0026rsquo;s Trajectory Optimization through Contact, we used the Hermite-Simpson transcription to improve the dynamic accruacy for the collocation points approximated as the nodes on cubic splines. In this work we also compared the optimization results with three different contact constraints:\n Sliding allowed contact constraints (SACC, right animation below) Non-sliding contact constraints (NSCC, left animation below) NSCC with one-sided spring constraints (OSS)  where different styles of walking gaits can be generated with different constraints. \r\r\nThe cost and the double support ratio of those three constraints are shown below, where the optimization result of OSS is probably premature because the additional complementary constraints to describe one-sided springs complicate the original formulation more.\n   Constraints SACC NSCC OSS     Cost of transport 0.048 0.049 2.664   Double support percentage 31.37% 35.48% 35.48%    In addition, towards to generate human-like motion, we added several schemes:\n Virtual springs on ankles to adjust the foot-rolling motion (e.g. adjust the gait to have clearer toe-off or heel-strike motions) and a aditional penalty cost to limit the activation of springs.

Since there was no human-sized bipedal robot has been successfully built in our lab before, it was a challenging task at that moment. one year later, with a well-planned schedule, the efficient execution, and the great team work, we managed to built the bipedal robot and the ZMP-based walking was successfully tested.\nMechanism design of the biped mechanism with trunk \r\r\r As shown in the figure (the highligt parts) above, I mainly designed the thigh and torso mechanisms. My main responsibilities of mechanism design include:\n The mechanism design (SolidWorks). Performed FEA analysis (CATIA and SolidWorks) with different mechanism groups to optimize the structure (as shown below). Checked the design with walking simulation. Chose proper mechanical components (bearings, timely belts/pulleys, harmonic drives and motors) to meet the requirements (from simulation). Generated CAD drawings, exploded views and documentations for mechanism fabrication and assembly.  \r Electronics development of the biped robot \r\r We used the distributed control system (with CAN Bus and USB) for the bipedal mechanism (as shown above). My mentor - Jiu-Lou Yan designed the main PCB boards for motor control, and I assisted him to solder those control boards, tested them and integrated the firmware/software to complete the entire system. My main responsibilities of the development of eletronics include:\n Soldered the control boards (motor driver with MCU) with motor testing. Arranged the wiring of the eletronics and trouble-shoot (as shown below). Wrote the firmware of the MCU (in control board) for the (joint) homing. Designed the PCB for CAN Bus to USB adapter, and wrote its firmware.  \r\r ",

Due to the impact, the flat contacts on both feet might break (which is not desired in double support). In this case, the ankle stabilizer adjusts the ankle orientations based on a simplified model to restore the flat contacts. \r  In the following simulation, the upper body motion is controlled to cancel the momentum about the vertical axis induced by the lower body movement, to mitigate the slipping in the walking simulation.
