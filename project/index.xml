      <description>In this project, I implemented the hybrid trajectory optimization and explore the walking generation on different terrains. As shown in the following figure, the optimization formulation contains modulaized constraints, so that it will be easier to customize different combinations of constraints. The current visualization results are rendered with SimScape Multi-Body as shown in the following videos (More videos of slope and stair walking are in preparation):

      <title>MathWorks, Safe trajectory tracking using Sawyer</title>

      <description>This is my last project at MathWorks Robotics Team (who develops the Robotics System Toolbox (RST)). Inspired by Haddadin&amp;rsquo;s famous demo, the idea is to demonstrate manipulator algorithms in RST for the safe robot-environment interaction to a ROS-enabled robot. In this project I implemented Haddadin&amp;rsquo;s time scaling method to achieve safe trajectory tracking on the Sawyer from Rethink Robotics. The purpose of this project is threefold:
 Contributed an simulation in Simulink with Simscape Multibody to showcase the usage of Robotics Manipulator Blocks.</description>

      <title>PhD project, Towards to human-like walking gait</title>

      <description>This is a project using trajectory optimization with direct collocation framework. The objective is to generate multi-domain walking for bipedal robot AMBER 3. Modified from Michael Posa&amp;rsquo;s Trajectory Optimization through Contact, we used the Hermite-Simpson transcription to improve the dynamic accruacy for the collocation points approximated as the nodes on cubic splines. In this work we also compared the optimization results with three different contact constraints:
 Sliding allowed contact constraints (SACC, right animation below) Non-sliding contact constraints (NSCC, left animation below) NSCC with one-sided spring constraints (OSS)  where different styles of walking gaits can be generated with different constraints.</description>

      <title>PhD project, QP-based Controller to Unify COM Planning and Torque Control</title>

      <description>In this work we designed a QP-based controller combining real-time walking pattern generation and constrained nonlinear control to achieve robotic walking under Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) and torque constraints.
This method utilize the fact that existing solutions to both walking pattern generation and constrained nonlinear control (summarized in the following table) have been independently constructed as Quadratic Programs (QPs, as shown below) and that these constructions can be related through an equality constraint on the instantaneous acceleration of the center of mass (COM).</description>

      <title>MS project, Mechatronics of a Humanoid Robot Nino</title>

      <description>In my second year of MS study, my main research objective is to build the bipedal mechanism for a human-sized humanoid robot (which called Nino later on) from a prototype design and run the developed ZMP-based walking on it. Since there was no human-sized bipedal robot has been successfully built in our lab before, it was a challenging task at that moment. one year later, with a well-planned schedule, the efficient execution, and the great team work, we managed to built the bipedal robot and the ZMP-based walking was successfully tested.</description>

      <title>MS project, Walking Control under Step Height Uncertainty</title>

      <description>This controller was degined to adapt uncertained step height. Two controllers are applied in different levels (as shown in the following figure):
 The ladning modification (triggered by impulse detection) determines the updated level height, holds the landing foot position, and switchs the state machine to double support when the impact occurs. Due to the impact, the flat contacts on both feet might break (which is not desired in double support).</description>
