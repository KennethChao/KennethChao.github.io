      <description>This is my last project at MathWorks Robotics Team (who develops the Robotics System Toolbox (RST)). Inspired by Haddadin&amp;rsquo;s famous demo, the idea is to demonstrate manipulator algorithms in RST for the safe robot-environment interaction to a ROS-enabled robot. In this project I implemented Haddadin&amp;rsquo;s time scaling method to achieve safe trajectory tracking on the Sawyer from Rethink Robotics. The purpose of this project is threefold:
 Contributed an simulation in Simulink with Simscape Multibody to showcase the usage of Robotics Manipulator Blocks.</description>

      <description>This is a project using trajectory optimization with direct collocation framework. The objective is to generate multi-domain walking for bipedal robot AMBER 3. Modified from Michael Posa&amp;rsquo;s Trajectory Optimization through Contact, we used the Hermite-Simpson transcription to improve the dynamic accruacy for the collocation points approximated as the nodes on cubic splines. In this work we also compared the optimization results with three different contact constraints:
 Sliding allowed contact constraints (SACC, right animation below) Non-sliding contact constraints (NSCC, left animation below) NSCC with one-sided spring constraints (OSS)  where different styles of walking gaits can be generated with different constraints.</description>

      <title>MS project, Mechatronics of a Humanoid Robot Nino</title>

      <description>In my second year of MS study, my main research objective is to build the bipedal mechanism for a human-sized humanoid robot (which called Nino later on) from a prototype design and run the developed ZMP-based walking on it. Since there was no human-sized bipedal robot has been successfully built in our lab before, it was a challenging task at that moment. one year later, with a well-planned schedule, the efficient execution, and the great team work, we managed to built the bipedal robot and the ZMP-based walking was successfully tested.</description>
